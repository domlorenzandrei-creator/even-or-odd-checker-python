# even-or-odd-checker-python
A simple Python console program that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 100 and determines whether the number is even or odd. 
The program also handles invalid input such as numbers outside the range or non-numeric characters.


Features

Input validation (accepts only integers)

Range checking (1–100 only)

Detects even or odd

Prevents crashes from wrong input

Continuous prompt until the user stops the program




How It Works

The program asks the user to input a number.

If the value is not a number → an error message is shown.

If the number is less than 1 or greater than 100 → an error message is shown.

Otherwise, the program prints whether the number is even or odd.




Example Run
Even or Odd Checker
Enter a number (1-100): 25
The number is odd.

Enter a number (1-100): 150
Please enter a number between 1-100.

Enter a number (1-100): hello
Please enter a valid number.
